# If you're running with bitcoin core:

# Get a deezy API key by emailing support@deezy.io and ask specifically to enable sat hunting

# A block explorer is needed to lookup fee rates, and for transaction and utxo lookup if bitcoin core is not used
# Default mempool.space may get rate limited so this allows for a local server if relevant

# Set a minimum size for sat ranges (e.g. block 78 sats). This is useful if you want to only hunt for sat ranges of a minimum size.
# For example, if you indicate block_78:1000, the script will not sequester a block 78 chunk unless the size is at least 1000 sats

# It is a configuration option that allows you to map specific tags to Bitcoin addresses.
# This is useful when you want to direct certain types of sats to specific addresses.
# The format for this configuration is an array of tag:address pairs, specified in order of priority.
# The script will use the first matching tag to determine where to send the sat.
# For example, if your configuration is uncommon:address123 omega:address345 and the script finds an uncommon omega sat, it will be sent to address123.
# However, if your configuration is omega:address345 uncommon:address123, the sat would be sent to address345.
# Therefore, the order of the tag:address pairs in your configuration matters.

# When splitting the outputs to the exchange, it will try to make outputs of this size.
